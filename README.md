# Odin Recipes

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. I'll be demonstrating how to structure a webpage using different elements such as:

- `<p>`: Paragraphs
- `<h1>`: Headings
- `<img>`: Images
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Lists
- CSS for styling the layout and design.

I'll also be committing the process onto GitHub, as I'll be able to track my progress and make any relevant modifications along the way.
